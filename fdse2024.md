# Numerical practicals for FDSE 2024

You will do three practicals

 - **Waves**: Propagation and dispersion of waves
 - **Waves and eddies**: basic processes with the Rotating Shallow Water model
 - **Turbulence**: two dimensional turbulence with and without buoyancy

The documents of the practicals can be found [here](https://filesender.renater.fr/?s=download&token=1e2ee043-bef7-4e55-b8ce-fc2da6c39ace)

The practicals are based on home-made Python codes. You'll need to
install them. Instructions are given below.


## 1) Waves

```console
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/pvthinker/wave2d
pip install netCDF4
```

you're ready to go. Wave2d is a FFT based code, entirely in
Python. This code requires the basic usual packages (numpy,
matplotlib) and also netCDF4.

To browse netCDF files, for this practical and the next, we will use
`ncview`, a simple and light browser but not installed at
Polytechnique. The solution is to install it via a conda virtual
environement, as follows

```console
/usr/local/anaconda3/bin/conda init
```

then open a new terminal to make conda active. The prompt line should start with (base)

```console
conda create -n ncview
conda activate ncview
conda install -c conda-forge ncview
```

you now have `ncview`. For a later session, don't forget to do conda
activate ncview to have it. The prompt should start with (ncview)



## 2) Waves and Eddies

```console
cd ~
git clone git@github.com:pvthinker/pyRSW.git
pip install numba
cd pyRSW
./install.sh
```

Once it is installed and whenever you want to use in a new terminal you need to make Python aware of where the code is (because we didn't install it the usual way)

```console
source ~/.pyrsw/activate.sh
```

and to test that the code works

```console
cd experiments/dipole
python dipole.py
```

should execute your first experiment.


PyRSW is a Python code that solves the Rotating Shallow Water Equations.





## 3) Turbulence


```console
cd ~
git clone git@github.com:pvthinker/Fluid2d.git
pip install mpi4py
cd Fluid2d
./install.sh
```

Once it is installed and whenever you want to use in a new terminal you need to make Python aware of where the code is (because we didn't install it the usual way)

```console
source ~/.fluid2d/activate.sh
```

and to test that the code works

```console
cd experiments/Vortex
python vortex.py
```

should execute your first experiment.


Fluid2d is a Python-Fortran CFD code that solves a large class of 2D flows.
